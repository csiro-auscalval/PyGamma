# Contributing #

Contributions to `gamma_insar` of all kinds are greatly appreciated!
Below we describe many different ways people with skills all kinds can help contribute to the project.

## User Feedback ##

Absolutely anyone can help out by giving us feedback on your experience with the project!  Giving feedback helps us better understand the issues users are facing, what's really working well / what we should do more of, and what's not working well / issues we need to prioritise fixing.

General feedback or questions about PyRate can be emailed to the [Geoscience Australia InSAR Team](insar@ga.gov.au)
For bug reports and issues, refer to the next section.

## Bug Reports ##

All bug reports can be raised as a [Github issue here](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/gamma_insar/issues)

If you are reporting a bug, please include:
 * Your runtime environment (operating system + version, what version of python you're using, etc)
 * Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
 * Detailed steps to reproduce the bug (including stack traces if possible).

If in doubt, refer to existing bug report issues for hints on what might be useful.

## Documentation ##

Documentation is a key factor in the success of any project.  We greatly appreciate any contributions to the project in the form of documentation, large and small every bit of documentation makes the project more accessible.

Examples of documentation that are useful:
 * User guides, examples, and tutorials
 * Technical documentation (explaining the nitty gritty of how parts of the project work)
 * Code documentation (eg: python docstrings)

We also greatly appreciate anyone who wants to write blog posts or articles about the project, please get in touch if you'd like to have your content referenced by our docs or promoted to an official guide!

## Fix Bugs ##

Not all bugs reports get the priority we would like, as such it's possible there are open bug reports sitting there waiting to be fixed!

Take a look at the [Github issues here](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/gamma_insar/issues) to get started, bug reports should have the `bug` label.

Please refer to the [code contribution guide](ContributingCode.md) for details on making code contributions for your bug fixes.

## Contribute Features ##

If `gamma_insar` lacks a feature you're willing to implement, code contributions are welcome!  Before getting started, we recommend opening a github issue with the `enhancement` label to get some feedback and advice to save you time duplicating code or putting in effort for no reason!

Additionally we may already have existing [Github issues](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/gamma_insar/issues) with the `enhancement` label just waiting for someone's time and attention!

Please refer to the [code contribution guide](ContributingCode.md) for details on getting started on this process.
